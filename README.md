# Image-Captioning-with-audio-generation
Assists visually impaired individuals in comprehending their surroundings.

This system automatically generates captions for input images and convert the generated captions to an audio format so that visually impaired individuals could listen to the generated captions. 

Image captioning makes the computer learn to use one or more sentences to understand the visual content of an image.

Captioning is performed using Deep Learning algorithm Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The detected text is converted to a voice message and delivered to the user through the Text-To-Speech API.
